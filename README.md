# Semester 4 project
This project was a console app using .NET.
The goal was to understand images data structure, and to realise a small image processing software, including fonctionalities such as color/shape manipulation,
applying confusion matrix, or reading a QR code.  
It was the first time that me and my teammate used GitHub.
